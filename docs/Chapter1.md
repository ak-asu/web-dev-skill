# Chapter 1: Web Fundamentals

## Chapter 1 Overview
**Learning Objectives:**
- Set up the repository locally
- Understand the basic project workflow
- Learn how to complete and submit quizzes
- Understand web fundamentals through a hands-on quiz

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

## Getting Started with the Course

### Setting Up Your Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine
   - Example command: `git clone <repository-url>`

2. **Explore the Project Structure**
   - This is a React/TypeScript project built with Vite
   - Key directories include:
     - `src/`: Contains the React components and TypeScript code
     - `docs/`: Contains learning materials and quizzes
     - `public/`: Holds static assets
   - Key configuration files:
     - `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts
     - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
     - `vite.config.ts`: Vite build configuration

### Understanding the Workflow
1. **Completing Tasks**
   - Read through the task instructions in each chapter
   - Make necessary changes to the files as instructed
   - Commit and push your changes to track your progress

2. **Completing Quizzes**
   - Quizzes are provided as Markdown files with multiple-choice questions
   - To answer, place an 'X' in the brackets [ ] next to your chosen answer
   - Example:
     ```
     [ ] A. First option
     [X] B. Second option (selected)
     [ ] C. Third option
     ```
   - Commit and push your answers to complete the quiz

3. **Running the React Application Locally**
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the development server: `npm run dev`
   - Access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)
   - Make changes to React components in the `src` directory to see them reflected in real-time

4. **Validation**
   - Automated checks will run to validate your submissions
   - If there are any issues, you'll receive feedback to help you correct them

## Web Fundamentals: A Brief Overview

### Client-Server Architecture
The web operates on a client-server model where:
- **Client**: Your web browser that requests and renders webpages
- **Server**: Remote computers that store and deliver web content
- Communication happens via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

### The Role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **HTML**: Provides structure and content (like headings, paragraphs, images)
- **CSS**: Controls appearance and layout (colors, fonts, positioning)
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior

### Static vs. Dynamic Websites
- **Static websites**: Content doesn't change unless manually updated
- **Dynamic websites**: Content generated on-demand, often personalized

## Your First Task
1. Read through this document to understand the course workflow
2. Open the Chapter 1 Quiz (`docs/Chapter1-Quiz.md`)
3. Answer all quiz questions by placing an 'X' in the brackets for your chosen answer
4. Commit and push your changes to complete Chapter 1

Remember: The goal of this first chapter is to get comfortable with the course format and tools while testing your understanding of basic web concepts.
